## Intro

Hey! I’m **Juan Esteban Sierra**, though I’m also known as **Jsierra**.  

I’m a multimedia engineer and indie developer passionate about **turning ideas into interactive worlds**.  
I love experimenting with **code, art, and design** to build games that feel alive — whether that’s a quick, punchy **2D platformer** or a fully realized **3D adventure**.

## About Me

Every project I make is another step in my journey to **learn, grow, and explore new ways to tell stories through play**.  
I believe games are one of the most expressive forms of art — a blend of logic, emotion, and creativity.  

If you enjoy **creative, personal, and heartfelt indie games**, welcome — you’ll feel right at home here. 🌻
